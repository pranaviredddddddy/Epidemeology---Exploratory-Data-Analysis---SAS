**Project - Exploring the Association Between Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Using NHANES Data**


**Introduction**


Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss among individuals aged 50 and older. Understanding the relationship between AMD and bone mineral density (BMD), an indicator of osteoporosis/osteopenia is essential to identify potential risk factors and inform public health strategies. This project explores the association between AMD and BMD using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

**Study Significance**


Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects the macula, leading to blurred or reduced central vision. This condition significantly impacts the quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily tasks such as reading and driving. Identifying factors associated with AMD can help in developing preventive measures and improving disease management. Bone mineral density (BMD) is another important health metric, particularly in older adults. Low BMD is indicative of osteoporosis or osteopenia, conditions that increase the risk of fractures.

**Data and Methods**


The data used in this analysis is derived from the NHANES dataset (NHANES_HW9.sas7bdat). The analysis includes the following variables:


AGE: Age of participants

SEX: Gender of participants

FEMORBMD: Bone mineral density of the femoral neck

OSTEO: Osteoporosis/osteopenia status

AMD2: Age-related macular degeneration status (binary)

AGEGRP: Categorized age groups (40 to <60 years, 60 to <75 years, 75 years and older)

OSTEO2: Dichotomized osteoporosis/osteopenia status

Hypotheses

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no significant association between age and bone mineral density.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a significant association between age and bone mineral density.
